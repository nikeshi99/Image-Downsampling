# Image-Downsampling

## About The Project

This repository includes all the project files related to the development of a `Custom processor in Verilog HDL` for image downsampling. The project was done by a team of 4 undergraduates at the Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering, University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. The team comprised of members, Pahan, Bimalka, Ravindu and myself. This project was done as a requirement of the module EN3030, Circuits and Systems Design.

The primary objective of this project was to design a Microprocessor and a CPU (Central Processing Unit) which can downsample a given `256x256` greyscale 8-bit image and generate correct results. This code can be modified to different input scales and different output scales. 

### Language
- Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL)

### Software tool
- Xilinx Vivado


This is an analysis and synthesis tool for the design of the processor and for the simulation of Verilog HDL designs.
